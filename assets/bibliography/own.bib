The clinical benefit for patients with diverse types of metastatic cancers that has been observed upon blockade of the interaction between {PD}-1 and {PD}-L1 has highlighted the importance of this inhibitory axis in the suppression of tumour-specific T-cell responses 1-9 . Notwithstanding the key role of {PD}-L1 expression by cells within the tumour micro-environment, our understanding of the regulation of the {PD}-L1 protein is limited 10-15 . Here we identify, using a haploid genetic screen, {CMTM}6, a type-3 transmembrane protein of previously unknown function, as a regulator of the {PD}-L1 protein. Interference with {CMTM}6 expression results in impaired {PD}-L1 protein expression in all human tumour cell types tested and in primary human dendritic cells. Furthermore, through both a haploid genetic modifier screen in {CMTM}6-deficient cells and genetic complementation experiments, we demonstrate that this function is shared by its closest family member, {CMTM}4, but not by any of the other {CMTM} members tested. Notably, {CMTM}6 increases the {PD}-L1 protein pool without affecting {PD}-L1 (also known as {CD}274) transcription levels. Rather, we demonstrate that {CMTM}6 is present at the cell surface, associates with the {PD}-L1 protein, reduces its ubiquitination and increases {PD}-L1 protein half-life. Consistent with its role in {PD}-L1 protein regulation, {CMTM}6 enhances the ability of {PD}-L1-expressing tumour cells to inhibit T cells. Collectively, our data reveal that {PD}-L1 relies on {CMTM}6/4 to efficiently carry out its inhibitory function, and suggest potential new avenues to block this pathway.},

	abstract = {Infiltration of human cancers by T cells is generally interpreted as a sign of immune recognition, and there is a growing effort to reactivate dysfunctional T cells at such tumor sites1. However, these efforts only have value if the intratumoral T cell receptor ({TCR}) repertoire of such cells is intrinsically tumor reactive, and this has not been established in an unbiased manner for most human cancers. To address this issue, we analyzed the intrinsic tumor reactivity of the intratumoral {TCR} repertoire of {CD}8+ T cells in ovarian and colorectal cancer—two tumor types for which T cell infiltrates form a positive prognostic marker2,3. Data obtained demonstrate that a capacity to recognize autologous tumor is limited to approximately 10\% of intratumoral {CD}8+ T cells. Furthermore, in two of four patient samples tested, no tumor-reactive {TCRs} were identified, despite infiltration of their tumors by T cells. These data indicate that the intrinsic capacity of intratumoral T cells to recognize adjacent tumor tissue can be rare and variable, and suggest that clinical efforts to reactivate intratumoral T cells will benefit from approaches that simultaneously increase the quality of the intratumoral {TCR} repertoire.},

	abstract = {© 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc. The efficacy of programmed cell death protein 1 ({PD}-1) blockade in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (﻿{TNBC}﻿) is low1–5, highlighting a need for strategies that render the tumor microenvironment more sensitive to {PD}-1 blockade. Preclinical research has suggested immunomodulatory properties for chemotherapy and irradiation6–13. In the first stage of this adaptive, non-comparative phase 2 trial, 67 patients with metastatic {TNBC} were randomized to nivolumab (1) without induction or with 2-week low-dose induction, or with (2) irradiation (3 × 8 Gy), (3) cyclophosphamide, (4) cisplatin or (5) doxorubicin, all followed by nivolumab. In the overall cohort, the objective response rate ({ORR}; {iRECIST}14) was 20\%. The majority of responses were observed in the cisplatin ({ORR} 23\%) and doxorubicin ({ORR} 35\%) cohorts. After doxorubicin and cisplatin induction, we detected an upregulation of immune-related genes involved in {PD}-1–{PD}-L1 (programmed death ligand 1) and T cell cytotoxicity pathways. This was further supported by enrichment among upregulated genes related to inflammation, {JAK}–{STAT} and {TNF}-α signaling after doxorubicin. Together, the clinical and translational data of this study indicate that short-term doxorubicin and cisplatin may induce a more favorable tumor microenvironment and increase the likelihood of response to {PD}-1 blockade in {TNBC}. These data warrant confirmation in {TNBC} and exploration of induction treatments prior to {PD}-1 blockade in other cancer types.},

	abstract = {© 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited. Cancer-associated systemic inflammation is strongly linked to poor disease outcome in patients with cancer1,2. For most human epithelial tumour types, high systemic neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios are associated with poor overall survival3, and experimental studies have demonstrated a causal relationship between neutrophils and metastasis4,5. However, the cancer-cell-intrinsic mechanisms that dictate the substantial heterogeneity in systemic neutrophilic inflammation between tumour-bearing hosts are largely unresolved. Here, using a panel of 16 distinct genetically engineered mouse models for breast cancer, we uncover a role for cancer-cell-intrinsic p53 as a key regulator of pro-metastatic neutrophils. Mechanistically, loss of p53 in cancer cells induced the secretion of {WNT} ligands that stimulate tumour-associated macrophages to produce {IL}-1β, thus driving systemic inflammation. Pharmacological and genetic blockade of {WNT} secretion in p53-null cancer cells reverses macrophage production of {IL}-1β and subsequent neutrophilic inflammation, resulting in reduced metastasis formation. Collectively, we demonstrate a mechanistic link between the loss of p53 in cancer cells, secretion of {WNT} ligands and systemic neutrophilia that potentiates metastatic progression. These insights illustrate the importance of the genetic makeup of breast tumours in dictating pro-metastatic systemic inflammation, and set the stage for personalized immune intervention strategies for patients with cancer.},

Still, technological platforms to study cancer T-cell interactions for individual patients and understand determinants of responsiveness are presently lacking. Here, we establish and validate a platform to induce and analyze tumor-specific T cell responses to epithelial cancers in a personalized manner. We demonstrate that co-cultures of autologous tumor organoids and peripheral blood lymphocytes can be used to enrich tumor-reactive T cells from peripheral blood of patients with mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these T cells can be used to assess the efficiency of killing of matched tumor organoids. This platform provides an unbiased strategy for the isolation of tumor-reactive T cells and provides a means by which to assess the sensitivity of tumor cells to T cell-mediated attack at the level of the individual patient. A modified patient-derived tumor organoids system allows the expansion of tumor-specific T cells from blood for personalized analysis of their anti-cancer properties.},

	abstract = {Immunotherapies are an emerging strategy for treatment of solid tumors. Improved understanding of the mechanisms employed by cytotoxic T lymphocytes ({CTL}) to control tumors will aid in the development of immunotherapies. {CTLs} can directly kill tumor cells in a contact-dependent manner or may exert indirect effects on tumor cells via secretion of cytokines. Here, we aim to quantify the importance of these mechanisms in murine thymoma {EL}4/{EG}7 cells. We developed an agent-based model ({ABM}) and an ordinary differential equation model of tumor regression after adoptive transfer of a population of {CTLs}. Models were parameterized based on in vivo measurements of {CTL} infiltration and killing rates applied to {EL}4/{EG}7 tumors and {OTI} T cells. We quantified whether infiltrating {CTLs} are capable of controlling tumors through only direct, contact-dependent killing. Both models agreed that the low measured killing rate of {CTLs} in vivo was insufficient to cause tumor regression. In our {ABM}, we also simulated {CTL} production of the cytokine {IFNg} in order to explore how an antiproliferative effect of {IFNg} might aid {CTLs} in tumor control. In this model, {IFNg} substantially reduced tumor growth compared with direct killing alone. Collectively, these data demonstrate that contact-dependent killing is insufficient for {EL}4 regression in vivo and highlight the potential importance of cytokine-induced antiproliferative effects in T-cell-mediated tumor control. Significance: Computational modeling highlights the importance of cytokine-induced antiproliferative effects in T-cell-mediated control of tumor progression.},

	abstract = {Many approaches to identify therapeutically relevant neoantigens couple tumor sequencing with bioinformatic algorithms and inferred rules of tumor epitope immunogenicity. However, there are no reference data to compare these approaches, and the parameters governing tumor epitope immunogenicity remain unclear. Here, we assembled a global consortium wherein each participant predicted immunogenic epitopes from shared tumor sequencing data. 608 epitopes were subsequently assessed for T cell binding in patient-matched samples. By integrating peptide features associated with presentation and recognition, we developed a model of tumor epitope immunogenicity that filtered out 98\% of non-immunogenic peptides with a precision above 0.70. Pipelines prioritizing model features had superior performance, and pipeline alterations leveraging them improved prediction performance. These findings were validated in an independent cohort of 310 epitopes prioritized from tumor sequencing data and assessed for T cell binding. This data resource enables identification of parameters underlying effective anti-tumor immunity and is available to the research community. Genomic tumor sequencing data with matched measurements of tumor epitope immunogenicity allows for insights into the governing parameters of epitope immunogenicity and generation of models for effective neoantigen prediction.},

However, without well-defined reference points it is difficult to determine which human tumors can be considered sufficiently foreign to the T-cell-based immune system. We established a neo-antigen prediction pipeline that processes single nucleotide variants, indels and gene fusion events and established its precision in identifying T-cell-recognized antigens. We used this pipeline to benchmark immunological foreignness of human cancers against pathogens for which T-cell control has been established. We demonstrate that up to 50\% of tumors, spanning 25 sites of origin, are more foreign than these pathogen benchmarks. In addition, we demonstrate that the neo-antigen repertoire of treatment-naïve tumors is not detectably influenced by immune editing. These data suggest that immunotherapeutic strategies that enhance activity of the endogenous T-cell compartment may be of value for a large fraction of human cancers.},
