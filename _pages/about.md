I'm a passionate computational biologist who performed his doctoral studies in the labs of 
Ton Schumacher and Lodewyk Wessels at the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam, the 
Netherlands. My PhD focused on cancer immunology, the study of immune interactions with 
cancer tissue with the ultimate goal of improving and personalizing cancer treatment with 
immunotherapies - therapies aiming to improve immune function in order to eradicate 
cancerous tissues.

I've been fascinated by both complexity and simplicity in biological systems for most of 
my life. I studied Biomedical sciences at the University of Amsterdam to foster this 
interest, where I could deepen my understanding of nature's
diversity and the architectures cell and tissue biology often adapt, frequently leading to 
complex emergent behaviour (e.g.  homeostasis, metabolism, immunity and most notably 
cognition).  I realized that the sheer diversity of biological components underpinning 
these processes quickly makes reasoning about them unfeasible using the human mind alone.  
This lead me down the path of bioinformatics and systems biology, which was the topic of 
my MSc studies. Having completed those and with an interest in contributing societal 
value, I next joined the Netherlands Cancer Institute to study cancer immunology using 
systems biology/bioinformatics/data science approaches. I'm currently finishing up my PhD 
studies.

Outside of 'work' I have many other interests. I'm broadly interested in all kinds of 
technology. I'm very concerned about climate change and volunteer at a environmental 
protection agency. I often road bike, swim or go running. I'm a passionate jazz/blues/pop 
guitarist. I like cooking and experimenting with coffee brewing methodology.
